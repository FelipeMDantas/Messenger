> This project is a Messenger look-alike that allows its users to authenticate with Google, Github or simply create an account. Then, they can chat with other users, verify whether they are online and, also, create conversation groups.

A couple of technologies were employed in this project. Among them:

- [ReactJS] - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [NextJS] - a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications
- [TypeScript] - a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript

- [NPM] - a package manager
- [Tailwind] - a utility-first CSS framework
- [Zustand] - a React state-manager that facilitates data persistence through screens
- [React Icons] - a dependecy that helps to include popular icons in React projects
- [Prettier] - a code formatter
